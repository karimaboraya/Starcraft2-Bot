# Starcraft2-Bot
construction of an AI bot for playing starcraft 2


This code constructs a bot for playing starcraft 2 automatically based on an implemented strategy. It relies mainly on construction of 
voidrays, Immortals and Photoncannons.

This code tried to implement machine learning strategies to predict the opponents moves but it couldn't be implemented due to lack in facilities,
as it needed high processing commputers and operating systems other than Windows.
